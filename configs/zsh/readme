Common shell options
====================

The following are some of the shell options that are most often used.
The descriptions are very brief; if you would like more information,
read the zshoptions manual page (type "man zshoptions").

# (1) Change directory given just path.
# unsetopt autocd                                                                              (no value set)
# (2) Use additional pattern matching features.
# unsetopt extendedglob                                                                        (no value set)
# (3) Append new history lines instead of overwriting.
# unsetopt appendhistory                                                                       (no value set)

# (5) Beep on errors.
# setopt beep                                                                                  (no value set)
# (6) Immediately report changes in background job status.
# unsetopt notify                                                                              (no value set)

# (0) or (q)  Return to main menu (no changes made yet)


=========

The function will not be run in future, but you can run
it yourself as follows:
  autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install
  zsh-newuser-install -f

The code added to ~/.zshrc is marked by the lines
# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
# End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
You should not edit anything between these lines if you intend to
run zsh-newuser-install again.  You may, however, edit any other part
of the file.
