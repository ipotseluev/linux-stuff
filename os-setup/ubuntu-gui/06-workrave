First, you'll need gnome-tweak-tool for being able to enable this.

sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
Second, the Workrave package in the official repo is badly packaged (it brings down some XFCE dependencies that mess up your Gnome session), so you'll have to install the workrave-gnome package from Rob Caeler's PPA.

sudo add-apt-repository -u ppa:rob-caelers/workrave
Now you can do:

sudo apt install workrave-gnome
Now fire up Workrave. It will show up in a small window with all the timers running -- no applet yet.

Then fire up gnome-tweak-tool, head to Extensions, and enable Workrave.

Now the applet (and/or the tray icon, if you're using it) should be visible in the top panel.

One more thing I've noticed on my machine is that Workrave segfaults under Wayland, so you will probably have to login into xorg if you want to use Workrave.
